Hi! Here are my solutions for [Advent of Code](adventofcode.com) 2016 in Python. <br>
I've started learning Python recently, so the solutions will probably not be the best or optimal ones. The purpose of this repository is to learn and improve my Python skills and maybe help someone else with their solutions.<br> 
I welcome any feedback you may have.
